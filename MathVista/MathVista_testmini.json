The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.\r\n\r\nIn Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \\mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. It then runs into and compresses a spring of spring constant $k=750 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{m}$. When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, by what distance $d$ is the spring compressed?",

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nCooper was a landscape architect who was hired to design a new city park. The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Cooper thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Then, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area.\nFigure: studying an architect's design. Which of the following could Cooper's test show?\nChoices:\n(A) if at least 20% of the park would be shaded by trees in each design\n(B) which design would have the least traffic noise in the concert area\n(C) which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road",

Because water vapour is itself a greenhouse gas, the increase in water vapour content of the atmosphere is of some concern to climate change experts. Predict the relative increase in water vapour in the atmosphere based on a temperature rises of $2.0 \\mathrm{~K}$, assuming that the relative humidity remains constant.

All samples in the same subband are quantized with the same quantizer, and the bit resolution of which is allocated by the codec. (The Bark scale is a psychoacoustical scale proposed by Eberhard Zwicker in 1961.) Fig. Q1a shows the frequency spectrum of a windowed segment of audio signal.
