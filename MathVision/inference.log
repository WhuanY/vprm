The image processor of type `Qwen2VLImageProcessor` is now loaded as a fast processor by default, even if the model checkpoint was saved with a slow processor. This is a breaking change and may produce slightly different outputs. To continue using the slow processor, instantiate this class with `use_fast=False`. Note that this behavior will be extended to all models in a future release.

One sunny day, Ling decided to take a hike in the mountains. She left her house at $8 \, \textsc{am}$, drove at a constant speed of $45$ miles per hour, and arrived at the hiking trail at $10 \, \textsc{am}$. After hiking for $3$ hours, Ling drove home at a constant speed of $60$ miles per hour. Which of the following graphs best illustrates the distance between Ling's car and her house over the course of her trip?
