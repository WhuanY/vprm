The vehicle is not shown in the image, so we can only infer its behavior based on the road markings and the \"SLOW\" sign.\n\nGiven the \"SLOW\" sign and the \"HUMP\" marking, it is reasonable to infer that the vehicle should be driving slowly. The road appears to be curving slightly to the left, which might require the vehicle to slightly steer to the left to maintain its course.
